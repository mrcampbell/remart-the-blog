# Hello, re:mart

Okay, let's layout a little bit of terminology here.



### Supply Chain Management

At every stage of the ecomomy, there is Supply Chain Management, which is the 
process of managing the flow of goods, services, money, manufacturing, from source material
to the end consumer.  It is a very broad term, but it has the following goals:


1. Reduce costs at every opportunity while still maintaining quality
1. Speed up the flow by forecasting, organizing, and planning manufacturing and delivery.
1. Make it so the rest of the business runs smoothly, nothing is late or ever runs out.

Supply Chain "techinically" includes delivery to the customer, but if we're being honest, that's clearly
not the case.  Tillamook Cheese makes sure that you have your favorite yoghurt in stock, and I can always 
count on them to have my 2lbs Sharp Cheddar in stock at my local Harmons, but that's not "supply chain", at least
not for me the customer.
